# KnowPad
I have made a program called KnowPad which uses C++ as the main programming language and uses the Qt Framework. It allows the user to write and store text and perform a variety of creative tasks on the text like
coloring text, highlighting text, copying and pasting, printing, etc. for better user experience using a text editor. It also has features that allow users to save and erase the work. This is
possible with the help of Qt a cross-platform application development framework and it also acts as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit for easy application development.
